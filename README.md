# ICDTrace

### *(deprecated)*

Old healthcare-solutions prototype I built using React.js for an NLP / ML startup.

This app took user-input diagnoses, ran that text against a pre-trained ML model via an API, then displayed the resulting insurance-billing codes ordered by confidence %

TL;DR: diagnosis text -> insurance code
